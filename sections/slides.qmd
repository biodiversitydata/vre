<br/>

- Earth is a **complex system** composed of subsystems involving physical, chemical and biological environments, characterized by **interacting processes** over a broad continuum of **time and space scales**.
- Necessity to have **technical frameworks & workflows to get, manipulate, process, and analyse FAIR research objects** (data, metadata and code sources, ...) from different sources (providers, format, standards)

**VRE, VL, SG…. ?**

> "Research done through distributed global collaboration enabled by the internet, using very large data collections, terascale computing resources and high performance visualization" (Sir John Taylor – 2001)

> "A VRE comprises a set of online tools and other network resources and technologies interoperating with each other to facilitate or enhance the processes of research practitioners within and across institutional boundaries" [JISC definition](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/implementing-a-virtual-research-environment-vre)

> "Virtual Research Environments are innovative, web-based, community-oriented, comprehensive, flexible, and secure working environments conceived to serve the needs of modern science» [Candela *et al.* 2013](http://doi.org/10.2481/dsj.GRDI-013)

- **Web** based
- Serve the **needs of researchers communities** (VRCs)
- Open and **flexible**

**VRE, VL, SG…. ?**

> **Virtual Research Environments** (VREs) are increasingly being used to support a more dynamic approach to collaborative working in systematics and taxonomy. Researchers who are not co-located are seeking **to work dynamically together at various scales from local to international**. These shared infrastructures are funded as VREs in Europe, **Virtual Laboratories** (VLs) in Australia and **Science Gateways** (SGs) in the USA and all have similar objectives.

## Virtual Research Environment : kesaco ?

**Key aspects**

- **Virtualisation** (hiding complexity from the user);

- access to useful resources such as **datasets**, **software**, **computing power**, **instruments/detectors** (the latter for control as well as data taking) and scholarly **publications** (including grey literature technical reports etc.) as well as **collaboratively with other persons and organisations**;
