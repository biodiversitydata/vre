Researchers who are not co-located are seeking **to work dynamically together at various scales from local to international**. These shared infrastructures are funded as VREs in Europe, **Virtual Laboratories** (VLs) in Australia and **Science Gateways** (SGs) in the USA and all have similar objectives.
